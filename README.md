# Vanilla Sword Blocking

This is a very simple plugin that **brings back the old sword blocking mechanichs**, allowing You to block with your sword to reduce taken damage by 50%. <br>
The best part about it: It's **server-only**, so Players don't even need to install a mod on their client for this - just add the plugin to the server and it works for everyone!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While this mod can be installed on any server version 1.21.2 and later, the blocking will only be displayed correctly by clients in version 24w44a (1.21.4) and later.
